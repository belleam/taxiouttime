# taxiouttime
Building linear regression models to predict taxi out time for planes at JFK airport.

The dataset was taken from an Academic Paper under Review by IEEE transportation and can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deepankurk/flight-take-off-data-jfk-airport). It contains data about flights leaving from JKF airport between November 2019 and December 2020.

To create a more accurate model, more correlated variables need to be collected.
